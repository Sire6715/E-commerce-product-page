E-commerce product page

Brief
Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
Add items to the cart
View the cart and remove items from it
Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
